                <p>	
                    When I was studying grade five in a remote village 80 km from Dhaka, Bangladesh, 
                    I was given the inspiration to study in Oxbridge or at the University of London. 
                    Benzir Butto (Ex-Pakistan PM) lost the election, and this was a newspaper headline. 
                    I have read about her and was fascinated by her achievement at Oxford University. That 
                    was when I wanted to study in a world-class university but was unsure where to start or how 
                    to prepare for the global competition. <br><br>
                    
                    Nearly a decade later, I secured a place to study Economics at the University of London. 
                    It was not an easy journey, as I had to accept many rejections. I made the 2008 UCAS application 
                    alone and did not get into the university I wanted to attend. I have worked on my grades, 
                    extracurricular activities, and personal statements to secure a place the following year. 
                    I also came across many of my peers at the university who had to struggle to secure a place 
                    because they did not have good admissions experts in their home country. I -founded an education
                     consulting firm with my university mate and gathered vast knowledge and experience in the field over the past 12 years. <br><br>
                    
                    In 2020 I decided to find Hansard education for dreamers to fulfil their goals. As Nelson Mandela said,
                     Education is the most powerful weapon we can use to change the world. Undoubtedly, future leaders want
                      to get this powerful weapon from a world-class place. The purpose of Hansard Education is to provide
                       bright students to live up to their dream and help to secure a place in their preferred institution. <br><br>
                    
                    There are thousands of consultancy in the market for university admissions, 
                    but I believe Hansard and its team can offer more than the status quo and add value to the future leader's life.</p>

                    level-headed to make the right steps in the present to be successful. Outside of academia, 
                    I enjoy writing as a hobby to allow a sense of escapism. Sports 
                    is also an area I love to follow and partake in – especially football!</p>
