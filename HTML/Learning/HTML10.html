    <p style="text-align: justify; color:black;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;The <span style="color: blue;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum" target="_blank">British Museum</a></span> is a public museum dedicated to human history, art and culture located in the Bloomsbury area of London. Its permanent collection of eight million works is 
    among the largest and most comprehensive in existence. It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present. The British Museum was the first public national museum to cover all fields of knowledge.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify; color:black"> &nbsp;&nbsp;The museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the Anglo-Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane.
    It first opened to the public in 1759, in Montagu House, on the site of the current building. The museum's expansion over the following 
    250 years was largely a result of British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, or independent spin-offs, the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;color:black">&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1973, the British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the British Museum, but it continued to host the 
    now separated British Library in the same Reading Room and building as the museum until 1997. The museum is a non-departmental public
     body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, and as with all national museums in the UK it charges no admission fee, except for loan exhibitions.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;color:black">&nbsp;&nbsp; Its ownership of a small percentage of its most famous objects originating in other countries is disputed and remains the subject
     of international controversy through repatriation claims, most notably in the case of the Elgin Marbles of Greece, and the Rosetta
      Stone of Egypt.</p>
