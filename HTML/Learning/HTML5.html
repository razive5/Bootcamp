        <p style="color: rgb(2, 2, 17);" style="text-align:justify ;">
            A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. 
            Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill,typically rising at least 300 metres (1,000 feet) above the surrounding land.
            A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.</p>
        

           <p style="color: rgb(2, 2, 17);" style="text-align: justify;"> Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, 
           erosion, or volcanism, which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years. Once mountain building ceases,
           mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as
           through erosion by rivers and glaciers.</p>

           <p style="color: rgb(2, 2, 17);" style="text-align: justify;">High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level at similar latitude. These colder climates strongly affect
           the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate,
           mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction, such as mining and logging, along with recreation, 
           such as mountain climbing and skiing.</p>

<p style="color:black" style="text-align: justify;">
    The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean) is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of 
    the surface of Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water. An ocean can also refer to any of the large bodies
    of water into which the world ocean is conventionally divided. </p>
    
    <p style="color:black" style="text-align: justify;">
    Separate names are used to identify five different 
    areas of the ocean: <span style="color:rgb(21, 2, 55);">
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" target="blank">Pacific</a>
    </span> (the largest), Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic (the smallest).[3][4] 
    Seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet. The ocean is the principal component 
    of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth. Acting as a huge heat reservoir, the ocean influences
    climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle.</p>

            The sky is an unobstructed view upward from the surface of the<span style="color:green"> 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" target="blank">Earth</a></span>. It includes the atmosphere and outer space. 
            It may also be considered a place between the ground and outer space, thus distinct from outer space. In the field of astronomy, the sky is also called the celestial sphere. This is an abstract sphere, concentric to the Earth, on which the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars appear to be drifting.
            The celestial sphere is conventionally divided into designated areas called constellations.
